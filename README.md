## UX & Design Reflection
The user interface was designed to be clean, minimal, and intuitive. Clear typography, consistent spacing, and large buttons ensure ease of use across devices. Immediate feedback and grammar explanations help users understand mistakes rather than simply identifying correct or incorrect answers. The linear quiz flow reduces cognitive load and keeps users focused on the learning task.

## Why This Project Works (Assessment Summary)
This project successfully meets the MS2 requirements by combining structured JavaScript logic with meaningful user interaction. The application manages state effectively, restricts user input appropriately, and provides immediate feedback to enhance learning. Clear UX decisions, accessibility considerations, and a responsive layout ensure the quiz is usable and engaging. Overall, the project demonstrates a solid understanding of front-end development fundamentals and practical JavaScript implementation.
